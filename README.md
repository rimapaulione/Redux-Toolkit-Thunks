## Redux Toolkit Action Creator Thunks project

<p>A simple React project designed for learning Redux Toolkit, Action Creators, and Thunk. I utilize 'Firebase' for real-time data storage, enabling data to be added to the cart and retrieved even when the page is reloaded. The project also includes notifications for 'success' or 'error' messages during data fetching.</p>
